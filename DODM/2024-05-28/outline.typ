== modeling maximum-flows and minimum-cuts

We have defined the maximum-flow problem by means of an ILP formulation.
We have shown that the network matrices associated to such ILP formulations are totally unimodular, which allows to drop the integrality constraints.
We then wrote the dual problem. Next, we worked out a combinatorial formulation of the dual and that was the minimum-cut problem.

We observed as maximum bipartite matching can be modeled as a maximum flow problem.
