previous meeting:
    instances, problems, models, languages
    examples: sum and difference, sum and product, systems of linear equations
    the role of induction in discrete mathematics/informatics
    P,NP,coNP, good conjectures and good characterizations
    example: Pirellone
    
today:    
   pure recursion, recursion with memoization, dynamic programming 
   - the Pascal-Tartaglia triangle as a first example for the need of memoization or dynamic programming
   - problem of dynamic programming:
         given an array of integers, choose a max sum subset of the entries of the array subject to the constraint that this subset does not include three consecutive entries.
